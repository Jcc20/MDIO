# 1st Assignment

In this project, we had to formulate a linear programming model from a real life situation, identifying its decision variables, data, restrictions and objetive function.
We then introduced this model into the **lpSolve** software in order to find the optimal solution (path).

The assignment was developed in **Deterministic Methods of Operational Investigation**, in the first semester of the 3rd and last year of the Bachelor's degree (2019/20).
