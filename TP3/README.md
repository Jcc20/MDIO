# 3rd Assignment

This last project was divided in two major parts:
* Part 0 + 1: Applying **critical path methods (CPM)** to a project, with the help of the **lpSolve** software, developing the respective network graphs and Gantt diagrams.
* Part 2: Figuring out which activities' duration to reduce, in order to lower the project's total execution time while keeping the additional cost at a minimum.

The assignment was developed in **Deterministic Methods of Operational Investigation**, in the first semester of the 3rd and last year of the Bachelor's degree (2019/20).
